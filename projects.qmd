## Stroke Severity Research

This project was conducted in collaboration with the Kinesiology Department at UGA. My team and I analyzed electronic health records from stroke patients within the largest hospital system in Athens, GA, with the goal of helping establish a patient recruitment network to advance UGA-based stroke research.

## Alzheimer's Research

This project was conducted at UC Irvine. My team and I investigated neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) associated with Down syndrome (DS). While NPS have been well studied in late-onset AD, their effects in patients with AD due to DS remain a gap in the literature. We found that NPS in DS and older adults were similar across cognitive groups, including cognitively stable, mild cognitive impairment, and clinical dementia. These similarities in the two groups may reflect shared amyloid or related pathology. Read more about our research here!
