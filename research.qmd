## Irvine Summer Institute in Biostatistics and Undergraduate Data Science (ISI-BUDS)

June 2024 - August 2024 [6 weeks]
Irvine, California, United States [On-site]

ISI-BUDS is a six-week paid internship at UC Irvine and is one of the Summer Institutes in Biostatistics (SIBS).

During the 2024 summer, my group and I researched neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in Down Syndrome and late-life Alzheimer’s disease patients, aiming to identify and compare patterns and the longitudinal change in NPS within patients with Down Syndrome and late-life Alzheimer’s disease patients. We applied methods in multiple linear regression and longitudinal data analysis.

## Biostatistics and Epidemiology Summer Training Program (BEST)

June 2023 - July 2023 [8 weeks]
New York, New York, United States [On-site]

BEST is an eight-week paid internship at Columbia University Mailman.

During the 2023 summer, I compared medical cost trajectories between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White lung cancer patients. These cost trajectories were estimated conditional on survival time, and I applied survival analysis methods and conducted nonparametric testing.
