I am a fourth-year statistics student at the University of Georgia and my research interests include:

-   methodologies: survival analysis, longitudinal data analysis, and clinical trial design
-   application: Alzheimer's disease, oncology, and health disparities.

I am currently applying to graduate school programs for Biostatistics and Statistics.
